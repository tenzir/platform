## What is Tenzir?

If you need to collect, parse, shape, normalize, aggregate, store, query, and
route security telemetry data at scale, you'll love how our pipelines manage
your dataflows. Tenzir makes it easy to quickly onboard and store data from
numerous sources, reduce data volumes to optimize cloud and data costs, and
execute detections and run analytics in-stream.

## Get started

This repository hosts the on-premise version of the Tenzir Platform and a
command-line utility for managing workspaces and nodes on the Tenzir Platform.

If you are a customer of the **Sovereign Edition**, deploy the Tenzir Platform
locally by following our [Deploy the platform][guide] setup guide step by step.
