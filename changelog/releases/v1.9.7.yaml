  This patch release comes with a number of frontend improvements since [Tenzir
  Platform v1.9.6](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.9.5):

  - This release completely overhauls the data inspector to give a more detailed
    tree view of the data, and makes it possible to collapse and expand the
    tree.
  - The copy button in the data inspector now copies the data as TQL instead of
    JSON.
