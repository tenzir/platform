title: TQL2 Switch Improvements
description: |
  This patch release includes the following improvements over [Tenzir Platform
  v1.9.5](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.9.5):

  - The TQL2 switch no longer shows in the Explorer for nodes that have the
    TQL2-only mode enabled through the `TENZIR_TQL2=true` option. This prepares
    for the upcoming Tenzir Node v5.0 release, which enables TQL2 by default.
