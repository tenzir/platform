This release also contains a large number of additional bug fixes and improvements:

**Infrastructure**

- We improved the `localdev` example setup for the Tenzir Platform. It now contains a Tenzir Node that is automatically connected to the local platform instance and a CLI container with admin permissions. Additionally, users of the `localdev` setup are now granted admin permissions by default.
- We fixed a bug in the alerts API that caused configured alerts to be only activated after the next restart of the websocket gateway.
- The new `TENZIR_PLATFORM_METRICS_STORE_S3_BUCKET_NAME` variable can be set to a valid S3 bucket name. If set, the platform stores all pipeline metrics it receives from connected Tenzir Nodes into this bucket.

**UI**

- The URL format was changed and now contains the workspace id, making it easier to share Tenzir Platform URLs with other users. NOTE: There is no automatic redirect, so old pipeline share url will not work anymore.
- The y-axis ticks for stacked area and bar charts were fixed.
- Fixed rendering of blobs in the `Data.Blob` component.
- Added BITZ and TQL as downloadable formats for events.
- Fixed an issue where pie chart colors were sometimes incorrect in the dashboard.

**CLI**

- We replaced the `--dry-run` option for the `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule` commands with the new `tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule` commands.
- The Tenzir Platform CLI now automatically authenticates using the client credentials flow when a client secret is provided as environment variable.
- The Tenzir Platform CLI now supports device code flow authentication for IdP's without a complete verification URL (like Microsoft Entra)"
