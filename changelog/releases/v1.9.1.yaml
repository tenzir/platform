  This patch release includes the following bug fixes over [Tenzir Platform
  v1.9.0](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.9.0), all of them
  geared towards Sovereign Edition users:

  - This release improves safety against accidentally logging secrets from the
    configuration
  - This release adds support for a new 'allow-all' auth rule that allows
    configuring global access to workspaces
  - This release adds support for using access tokens as a fallback for id
    tokens in the CLI
  - This release adds support for a new `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ID_TOKEN` override
    to manually set a valid id token for the CLI, instead of going through an
    OIDC flow
