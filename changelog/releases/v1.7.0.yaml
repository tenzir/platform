  This release introduces a new Drag'n'Drop feature to easily work with data
  from local files, and adds additional configuration knobs for Sovereign
  Edition users.

  Sovereign Edition users get a few more options to customize their deployment:
  * `ANALYTICS_WEBHOOK_URL`: Allows configuring an analytics sink for sending
    events
  * `TLS_KEYFILE`/`TLS_CERTFILE`: Allow the platform and websocket gateway
    services to provide native TLS support, when not running behind a reverse
    proxy
