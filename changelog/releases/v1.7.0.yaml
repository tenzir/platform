title: Tenzir Platform v1.7
description: "In this release, we introduce a new Drag'n'Drop feature to easily work with data from local files, and some additional configuration knobs for Sovereign Edition users.

Users of the sovereign edition also get a few more options to customize their deployment:
 * `ANALYTICS_WEBHOOK_URL`: Allows configuring an analytics sink for sending events
 * `TLS_KEYFILE`/`TLS_CERTFILE`: Allow the platform and websocket gateway services to provide native TLS support, when not running behind a reverse proxy
