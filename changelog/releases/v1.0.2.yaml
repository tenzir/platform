  This patch release contains the following bug fixes and improvements over
  [Tenzir Platform
  v1.0.1](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.0.1):

  - This release fixes a potential hang when opening the history when it
    contains some pipelines whose definition must be URL-encoded.
  - Sorting schemas now has a deterministic order when both a schema and a
    category with the same name exist, e.g., for a schema `foo` and `foo.bar`.
  - This release fixes a bug that potentially leads to corruption of dashboard
    configurations after loading the dashboard fails.
  - This release fixes a hang when adding a chart to a dashboard without
    assigning a name explicitly.
