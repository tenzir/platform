description: "Tenzir Platform v0.20 brings the following improvements and changes:

* The new `tenzir-platform admin spawn-node` CLI command allows running nodes with arbitrary Docker images
* The CLI no longer requests the 'email' scope by  default when using the non-interactive login,  fixing a compatibility issue with the keycloak identity provider
* We reduced the CPU usage of activity spark bars in the pipelines list, making them update more smoothly.
* Spark bars no longer stop updating for stopped pipelines.
* We fixed a bug that caused an increased network usage from fetching diagnostics and metrics in the app.
