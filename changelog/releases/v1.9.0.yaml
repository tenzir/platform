title: Tenzir Platform v1.9
description: "With this release, we revamped the Explorer to better support large datasets:

ðŸ‘‰ We wrote a blog post that explains the improvements in detail: https://docs.tenzir.com/releases/tenzir-platform-v1.9

Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes and improvements:
- The _Add to Dashboard_ button in the Explorer is no longer disabled when the corresponding history entry is removed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the _Save_ button on dashboards from working. The save button now also shows a loading state when applicable.
- We made pie chart legends scrollable.
- All log scales in charts have been changed to symlog scales, which handle zero and negative values more gracefully."
