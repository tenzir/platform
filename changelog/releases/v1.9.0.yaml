description: |
  This release revamps the Explorer to better support large datasets.

  Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes and improvements:
  - The _Add to Dashboard_ button in the Explorer is no longer disabled when the
    corresponding history entry is removed.
  - This release fixes a bug that prevents the _Save_ button on dashboards from
    working. The save button now also shows a loading state when applicable.
  - This release makes pie chart legends scrollable.
  - All log scales in charts change to symlog scales, which handle zero and
    negative values more gracefully.
